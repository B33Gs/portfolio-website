              <h2>Overview:</h2>
              <p>
                Movie Craze is a full stack web application that utilizes the
                MERN stack. Users of this app are able to browse info on movies,
                genres and directors. After creating an account, users can
                change their user info as well as create and edit a list of
                their personal favorite movies.

              <h2 class="underline">Purpose & Context:</h2>
              <p>
                Movie Craze was a project I created during my full stack
                development course through CareerFoundry. This ambitious
                application was meant to refine my JavaScript skills as well as
                learn the MERN stack.

              <h2>Objective:</h2>
              <p>
                The goal of Movie Craze was to test and expand my JavaScript
                skills by creating my first full stack application. In addition
                to learning the MERN stack, this project would also familiarize
                me with the concept of frameworks and servers, leaving me with a
                well rounded development toolkit.

              <h2>The Process:</h2>
              <h3>Step 1: Build a server to handle requests</h3>
              <p>
                Building the server for this app was like laying the foundation
                for the front end. All of the functionality I would be giving to
                the client side would come from the work I was putting in here.
                Creating the back end served as my introduction to Node,
                MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, PostgreSQL, Postman, among other
                tools, and put new focus on making quality and timely commits to
                GitHub.
              </p>
              <p>
                Building the server had its difficulties, but with help from my
                amazing mentor and tutor, I was able to get through it without
                any catastrophic issues. One of the biggest things I learned
                during this phase was the value in taking breaks and when to
                take them. Learning when it was time to take a break quickly
                became one of my most important tools to stay productive.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3>Step 2: Create the client side of Movie Craze</h3>
              <p>
                The client side was where all of the hard work I’d put in on the
                backend could finally be shown off. Through the implementation
                of React, I would be able to generate visual components from the
                database I’d created along with the server side of the app. I’ll
                never forget how powerful I felt writing code for a single
                component, then watching it populate a list of formatted items
                for each movie in my database.
              </p>

                class="image-right image"
                src="./img/main-view-code.png"
                alt=""
              />
              <p>
                Learning to manage data throughout my app was by far my biggest
                hurdle, and one I may not have made it past without the help of
                my amazing mentor. Through our weekly sessions, I learned how to
                zero in on errors by following the data and working through the
                code systematically as well as refining how I taught myself new
                tools
              </p>

              <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
              <p>
                Movie Craze was an incredibly demanding project and definitely
                the toughest challenge I’ve faced so far. However, that struggle
                led to massive growth as a developer and taught me the true
                strength of being part of a team. Working with others on
                debugging informed my approach to finding errors in ways that I
                may not have learned so quickly on my own. Working on this app
                has refined my problem solving skills and created an undeniable
                hunger for larger projects with bigger teams.
