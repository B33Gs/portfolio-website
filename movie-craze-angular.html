              <h2>Overview:</h2>
              <p>
                MovieCraze-Angular is an Angular app that uses HTML, SCSS,
                Typescript, Angular Router, and Angular Material. The backend is
                my Movie-API that was utilized in the React version of
                MovieCraze.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="underline">Purpose & Context:</h2>
              <p>
                The purpose of MovieCraze-Angular is to expand my knowledge of
                frameworks to include Angular, as well as learn Typescript. In
                addition, a Kaban board was used to keep the project on track
                and easier to manage.
              </p>
            </div>

              <h2>Objective:</h2>
              <p>
                The objective of MovieCraze-Angular is to create the client side
                for a movie API using Angular. The backend is a Rest API I
                created called Movie-API. The project includes documentation as
                well.
              </p>

              <h2>The Process:</h2>
              <h3>Step 1: Basic Angular and Typescript</h3>
              <p>
                I had initially expected for Angular to be a little similar to
                React than it was. All of the file structures, state management,
                and in general, how I used Javascript to do things, all felt
                totally different.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then there was Typescript. Although very similar to Javascript,
                learning this statically typed language wasn't without it's
                challenges. Fixing the first few data type errors was slightly
                frustrating, but in time, I got hte hang of it and started to
                enjoy the extra control I had over my data.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Step 2: Advanced Angular and Material</h3>
              <p>
                After learning the basics of Angular, I began to embrace the
                differences between it and React. I enjoyed working with a
                template and got a handle on passing data from template to
                component and visa versa. The syntax ultimately felt a lot
                cleaner and easier to manage.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the toughest challenges I ran into was with objects
                behaving as expected. A movie object passed into the template
                that wouldn't display it's ID, user objects not outputting their
                names. At first, frustration and mystery, but overtime I learned
                that most of my issues were due to insufficient data types. This
                lead me to using classes so my types could be more accurate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly there was Angular Material, which I think I may have
                fallen in love with. It was like making a button and throwing
                several Bootstrap classes on it, all by importing a module,
                making a button, and telling it what kind of button to be. It
                felt a lot cleaner than using bootstrap like I have in the past.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
              <p>
                MovieCraze-Angular was a huge confidence builder to make. I
                couldn't help but think back to the first Javascript errors I
                ran into when I was creating my first few apps. Issues that
                would have stumped me for days back then, were now something I
                could figure out in 15 or so minutes with google.
              </p>
              <p>
                I finally started to feel like I was becoming a developer that
                was capable of planning, learning new technology and
                troubleshooting effectively. More than that, I was having a ton
                of fun doing it all. This project more than any other has gotten
                me really excited to get a job and working with teams on big
                real world applications.
