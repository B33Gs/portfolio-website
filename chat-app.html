              <h2>Overview:</h2>
              <p>
                The goal with ChatBox was to create a chat app for mobile
                devices using React Native. The app provides users with a chat
                interface and the ability to share images and their locations.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="underline">Purpose & Context:</h2>
              <p>
                ChatBox was a way to learn React Native. Experience with Native
                would allow me to make applications for both iPhone and Android
                without having to learn Swift and Kotlin.

              <h2>Objective:</h2>
              <p>
                People are using their phones more and more every day to help
                them in their daily lives. Wether it's helping them keep tract
                of everything they have to do, or helping them stay connected
                with their friends. This was an opportunity to learn how to
                create native mobile apps without having to learn two different
                languages.
              </p>

              <h2>The Process:</h2>
              <h3>Step 1: Learning React Native</h3>
              <p>
                The first step of creating ChatBox, was to learn the basics of
                React Native. This part of the process felt rather straight
                forward. Native does a great job of making it easy to create a
                layout for your app. Passing the few props that were necessary
                felt familiar and functioned as expected almost imediately.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main difference I noticed between React and Native was the
                lack of all the React based elements I was used to. Using just a
                small amount of elements, mainly Text and View, definitely felt
                lacking, but made it easy to put everything together.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Step 2: Working with Gifted Chat</h3>
              <p>
                This was easily the most difficult part of building this app.
                The documentation, although helpful, wasn't as thorough as other
                docs I've used. It being as new as it is, also meant that things
                are constantly changing. With that and the small amount of posts
                on sites like Stack Overflow, finding solutions to felt a lot
                more difficult than what I've experienced in the past.
              </p>
              <p>
                In one case, the only clarification I could get was by looking
                at the source code itself, which I'd never had to do before. It
                made what felt like it could have been a simple project,
                decently difficult to build. Still, this is an experience I'm
                thankful for, as it was a great opportunity to add another tool
                to my troubleshooting tool belt.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Step 3: Cloud Firestore and Native Async Storage</h3>
              <p>
                Both of these tools felt pretty familiar and easy to use. I
                really enjoyed using firebase to manage ChatBoxe's message
                storage. It was great to work with, super straight forward
                required minimal setup.
              </p>
              <p>
                Similarly, React Native Async Storage was pretty straight
                forward to learn and use. Beyond getting to know how it worked,
                there were no snags in getting it up and runnning. It also added
                much needed functionality, allowing users to use ChatBox even
                when they weren't connected to the internet.
              </p>

              <h2>Conclusion:</h2>

              <p>
                One the biggest frustrations in this process was Expo. Although
                it's a powerful tool, it made the development experience feel
                clunky and bogged down. I can't count the times I had to restart
                the mobile app so it would update and see new code.
              </p>
              <p>
                The same went for using the Android simulator. It was the only
                way I had of testing on an Android device, but it also caused a
                lot of downtime in the development process, wiping the device so
                I could reload the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                All in all, I'm glad I made this app. I learned a lot about
                working with newer technologies, which will help to inform my
                choices on technologies I want to use in my own projects moving
                forward. It also got me interested in learning Swift and Kotlin.
