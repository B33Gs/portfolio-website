              <h2>Overview:</h2>
              <p>
                Meet is a serverless Progressive Web Application using AWS
                Lambda and Jest for testing, along with a host of other tools.
                The app utilizes Google Calendar API to populate a list of
                events that the user can sort by city and dictate the amount of
                events to show.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="underline">Purpose & Context:</h2>
              <p>
                The learning goals for my Meet app was to dive into serverless
                functions, end to end testing as well as data visualization. In
                addition it is another opportunity to refine my React and
                Javascript skills.

              <h2>Objective:</h2>
              <p>
                Create a serverless progressive web application that uses Google
                Calendar API to populate lists of events. Every step of the
                process was implemented using test driven development to ensure
                error free code. Performance monitoring was to be done with
                Atatus.

              <h2>The Process:</h2>
              <h3>Step 1: Test Driven Development</h3>
              <p>
                Although this is step one, it was the theme from the beginning
                to the end of Meet’s development. Initially I was intimidated by
                TDD, but soon I found myself enjoying testing as I was building.
                This approach made the troubleshooting process more streamlined,
                since the tests could tell me what was working and what wasn’t.
                This resulted in more time spent coding and less trying to find
                where errors were originating.
              </p>
              <p>
                Learning to use Jest was tough, but it’s value immediately
                apparentn and well worth any struggles. I utilized the
                documentation quite frequently while I was testing my app. I
                found several times after feeling stuck trying to make a test
                pass that the test itself was the issue. Upon finding the
                correct testing methods for a particular application, things
                usually fell into place quite quickly.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3>Step 2: Implementing Serverless Functions with AWS</h3>
              <p>
                Serverless felt like a truly foreign concept. That being said, I
                understand why using AWS was the correct tool for this
                particular application. It had far less functionality than the
                more robust backend that powered MovieCraze, and creating a
                server would have resulted in a lot of unnecessary effort and an
                overall bulkier application.
              </p>
              <p>
                The toughest part of serverless was definitely not having access
                to the console in the same way I’m used to with other apps. Not
                being able to check data at anypoint in the process by logging
                an output to the console was definitely challenging. In time
                though, I ended up getting a feel for working in this new,
                alien, environment. I’m definitely looking forward to refining
                my serverless skills even further in future projects.

              <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
              <p>
                Meet has been a truly challenging application to build, but
                resulted in me learning some tools and workflows that I
                genuinely enjoy. Test driven development is definitely one of my
                favorites out of the concepts I’ve learned so far in my web
                development journey. This project has made me a much stronger
                developer. It was also a chance to celebrate how far I’ve come
                in being able to troubleshoot complex problems.
