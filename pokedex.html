              <h2>Overview:</h2>
              <p>
                Pokedex is a small web applicationo that leverages HTML, CSS,
                and Javascript. It renders data collected from an external API
                and allows users to learn more about their favorite Pokémon.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="underline">Purpose & Context:</h2>
              <p>
                The best way to learn a new programming language is to build a
                site with it, and that's exactly why I built Pokédex. It allowed
                me to learn javascript, while laying the foundation to build an
                API inthe future. Additionally it served as a great way for me
                to further improve my HTML and CSS skills.
              </p>

              <h2>Objective:</h2>
              <p>
                The goal of Pokédex was for users to be able to view a list of
                their favorite Pokémon and learn details about them. It was to
                include a search field that would allow users to filter the list
                by name.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>The Process:</h2>
              <h3>Step 1: Basic Javascript</h3>
              <p>
                The first step in this app, was to learn the core concepts of
                Javascript, like objects, arrays, conditionals and loops. This
                step was to be the foundation of my future JS skills. I learned
                to map and filter arrays as use conditionals like if/else. These
                skills would prove to be absolutely invaluable moving forward.
              </p>
              <p>
                I honed and leveraged my newly acquired skills, using an IIFE to
                keep my states safe from accidental changes and used forEach
                loops to map the temp data I created as a placeholder for what
                would be data from the API. Although it all felt akward at
                first, and the amount of code seemed hard to keep track of, very
                soon, I found myself drunk with the power of Javascript!
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Step 2: API interaction</h3>
              <p>
                Utilizing APIs felt a bit like magic. Target the right data, map
                it, and BANG, a website full of content that I didn't make. This
                was my first real introduction to understanding data structures.
                Learning how to look at an object and target whatever
                information I wanted was tough, but fun.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
              <p>
                My Pokédex app was an absolute blast to make. In the beginning,
                I was super unfamiliar with Javascript felt fairly alien after
                my time spent learning HTML and CSS, but the more I worked with
                it, the more sense it made and the more I bagan to realize how
                powerful a language it was.
